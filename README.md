This is a Java app which pulls album art from the itunes api for a specified keyword(s). After collecting the images, they are all displayed in a grid of 20 images. Each second, a random image on the grid is switched out for another image in the collection. The program relies on the [gson library](https://github.com/google/gson), which helps with interacting with JSON and Java objects. 

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with Javafx and practice interacting with external api's. 

## Example

Below is what the program looks like.
