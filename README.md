# Gallery Fork

This is a Java app which pulls album art from the itunes api for a specified keyword(s). After collecting the images, they are all displayed in a grid of 20 images. Each second, a random image on the grid is switched out for another image in the collection. 

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with Javafx and practice interacting with external api's.
